    </div>
    <div class="font2 section-headings">
        <h2>What are they?</h2>
        <p>
            Unknown attachments in cybersecurity are essentially attachments in emails or other messaging services that contain a file that you can not preview. These attachments can be dangerous, as you often times can't possibly know what they can do to your computer, or the data on your computer.</br>
            In this short summary, you will learn what unknown attachments can do, what they are, how to detect them, and how to prevent them.
        </p>

        <h2>What Can Unknown Attachments Do?</h2>
        <p>
            Unknown attachments can very often be malicious, which means that they can contain viruses or software that can damage your computer, spy on what you are doing, or even take control of your computer entirely. Just a single click on an attachment from a suspicious email can completely destroy your computer and leak your personal information.</br>
            These attachments also don't have to be 'unknown'. They can also be files that you are familiar with that can download malware onto your computer. Cybercriminals are very sneaky, and they can find out information on you or the company that a worker works for in order to build a convincing email, tricking you into believing they are trustworthy. This is called a social engineering cyberattack.</br>
            People have had their entire life flipped upside down just from clicking or downloading an unknown attachment. So I warn you, but how can you detect these dangerous attachments?

        <h2>What Exactly Are Unknown Attachments?</h2>
        <p>
            Unknown attachments can either be perfectly fine, and not malicious at all, or they can be devastating to your computer and your personal information. Unknown attachments can contain scripts and computer code that can instantly get into the system of your computer and send your personal information to another user on the internet.</br>
            Malicious software can be written in any language and be formatted in any file. Even if you are sent a document that is just a .pdf file, it can contain malicious software. The most risky type of file that you can click is a .exe (or exectuable) file. Never ever click on or run a .exe file coming from someone that you don't know.
            Now that we know what they are and how they can be in any format, how could we possibly tell the difference between a real attachment and a malicious one?

        <h2>How to Detect Malicious or Unknown Attachments</h2>
        <p>
            Malicious or unknown attachments can come out of nowhere on the internet. You may even think you are chatting with a friend and they send you a file and when you click on it, you are suddenly under a cyberattack. This is because cybercriminals are very sneaky and convincing with what they do. </br>
            Cybercriminals like mentioned in the above section are extremely good at convincing people that they are someone who you can trust. Even through footprinting, cybercriminals can get into the systems of offices and companies through holes in the cybersecurity of the company, and gather information on the company so they can formulate convincing emails.</br>
            The most foolproof way of not getting attacked by malicious and unknown attachments is by never clicking on an attachment that comes out of the organization, or if you are at home, never click on an attachment from an email that comes from someone that you don't know. If the attachment is coming from a company, verify and research and make sure that the email address that the email is originating from is real and doesn't have any mistakes.</br>
            Emails that come from large companies will not have spelling mistakes. If there are any spelling mistakes or bad grammar in the email from the company that the attachment is linked to, do not click the attachment.</br>
            Now that we know how to detect malicious or unknown attachments, how do we actually prevent the attacks from happening and prevent the emails from being sent in the first place?
    </div>
    <div class="font2 section-headings">
        <h2>How to Prevent Attacks from Unknown Attachments</h2>
        <p>
            The most common way to prevent unknown attachments from being sent is by having a spam filter in your network or your device. These filters can filter out any emails coming from an unknown or outside source and prevent most scam emails from being delivered. </br>
            Sometimes cybercriminals can slip through the cracks of the system if you work at a company, and if there is a cybercriminal in the system, it is up to the company's IT department to keep that from happening. The best that you can do is make sure to be very careful about what attachments you click on.</br>
            Some emailing software can detect most malicious files in an email if they appear. Common and large services such as gmail have built in malicious software detection which scan the attachments for dangerous code. You can always click on or run the attachment anyway, but gmail will warn against it. </br>
            Another software that protects you from the dangers of malicious code is your device itself. Oftentimes there are precautions put in place by your computer or device that warns you against the running and opening of a file. Most of the time malicious content will warn you, but sometimes cybercriminals are more clever than that, and can work around the warnings so you are not prompted. </br>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            Now you know briefly about what unknown attachments can do, what they are, how to detect them, and how to prevent attacks from malicious attachments. The internet can be a dangerous place, and I always warn against the dangers of being click-happy in emails and online. </br>
            Finally, always be careful in emails. It is estimated that companies lose $1,797,945 per minute due to cybercrime. If you want to protect you and possibly your organization from adding to this number, always be careful and safe on the internet, and use these tips above to keep yourself safe.
