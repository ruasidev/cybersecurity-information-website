        <h2>What are they?</h2>
        <p>
            Unknown attachments in cybersecurity are essentially attachments in emails or other messaging services that contain a file that you can not preview. These attachments can be dangerous, as you often times can't possibly know what they can do to your computer, or the data on your computer.</br>
            In this short summary, you will learn what unknown attachments can do, what they are, how to detect them, and how to prevent them.

        <h2>What can unknown attachments do?</h2>
        <p>
            Unknown attachments can very often be malicious, which means that they can contain viruses or software that can damage your computer, spy on what you are doing, or even take control of your computer entirely. Just a single click on an attachment from a suspicious email can completely destroy your computer and leak your personal information.</br>
            These attachments also don't have to be 'unknown'. They can also be files that you are familiar with that can download malware onto your computer. Cybercriminals are very sneaky, and they can find out information on you or the company that a worker works for in order to build a convincing email, tricking you into believing they are trustworthy. This is called a social engineering cyberattack.</br>
